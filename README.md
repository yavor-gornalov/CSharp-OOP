# C# OOP - Module
This repository contains solutions to tasks related to problems solved during the study of the 'C# OOP' module at SoftUni. The module covers principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and objects, object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. Demonstrated OOP principles include abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Usage of decorators and component testing (writing unit tests) are also covered. Exercises are prepared for testing in the Judge system. Problem explanations can be accessed after registration at this [LINK](https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/#!/List/ByCategory/184/CSharp-OOP-Exercises).
